# Quadratic-Drag-Model
I don't have much to say, but:
This code can be used to numerically solve the quadratic drag model while creating a 3D model and a graph. Enter in your own values and hit "Run". That easy! 

In case you don't have vpython amd matplotlib, use "pip install vpython" and "pip install matplotlib" respectively
